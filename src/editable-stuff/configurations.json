  "aboutDescription": "I am currently a sophomore majoring in Computer Science and intending to major in Cognitive Science at UC Berkeley. I was born in China, but I spent most of my childhood in Seattle, WA. So far, I have taken advantage of Berkeley by taking courses about Information Devices, Data Structures, Discrete Mathematics, and Probability Theory. In the fall, I will be taking Computer Architecture/Machine Structures and Efficient Algorithms & Intractable Problems. In my free time, I like to play basketball, piano, workout, and recently got invested in remixing Electronic Dance Music. ",
